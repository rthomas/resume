\section*{Professional Experience}
\textbf{Google, Ireland\\Technical Program Manager --- Search SRE\\October 2014 --- Current}\\\\
As a part of the Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team my focus was driving strategic projects for the Search Serving team as well as collaborative projects with the teams in the serve, crawl and indexing teams.
\\\\
This role requires me to develop programs of work, achieve buy-in from globally distributed teams, define deliverables and expectations as well as track work through the project and program lifecycles.
\\\\
Due to the geographical distribution of the teams (Mountain View, New York, Zurich, Dublin, Sydney) definition of work and delegation to other program managers is essential.
\section*{Previous Employment}
\textbf{Atlassian, Sydney, N.S.W.\\Engineering Team Lead\\December 2009 --- October 2014}\\\\
Leading teams of up to seven people, I have taken on many challenging projects and have been able to deliver on time and without cutting scope.
\\\\The projects have generally been in the area of how Atlassian delivers software to its hosted platform, and most recently an ongoing project to develop and deliver an internal PaaS for hosting and deploying services inside of Atlassian.
\\\\
This role has required me to manage engineering resources, liaise with project stakeholders, set (\& reset) project goals and present justification of the projects to executives.
\\\\
The projects I have run:
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop an internal PaaS for Atlassian (think private Heroku), this is a cross-organisational project --- \textbf{Ongoing}
\item Design \& build a mechanism to track hosted software delivery from development through to production.
\item Design \& build a framework to orchestrate the upgrade of ~90,000 JVMs in the Atlassian OnDemand environment.
\item Managed the integration of customers and Atlassian Partners into the Confluence 4.0 ecosystem.
\item Build the Confluence Continuous Deployment infrastructure used internally at Atlassian, this was then picked up by other product teams.
\end{itemize}
I am an accomplished public speaker and have presented on the following topics:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Delivering New Features to Over 30,000 Customers --- Daily}\\Atlassian Summit, October 2013
\item \textbf{Design Patterns for Confluence Add-ons}\\Atlassian AtlasCamp, May 2013
\item \textbf{Closing the Loop - DevOps and Agility in Production}\\Agile India, February 2013

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Objective Corporation Limited, North Sydney, N.S.W.\\Software Engineer / Enterprise Search Specialist\\August 2009 --- December 2009}\\\\
My role at Objective Corporation was to take ownership of the search and indexing services of the Objective Software Suite and provide guidance and support for the current and future implementations. These services utilise Verity's K2 search server and I was tasked with investigating and prototyping a replacement; with Apache Solr being the selected at the time.\\\\
\textbf{Australian Defence Force --- Army\\Trainee Pilot\\March 2008 --- June 2009}\\\\
I have completed the Australian Defence Force Basic Pilots Course and Army Intermediate Pilots Course and hold a military endorsement for the PAC CT-4B aircraft for day and night operations.\\\\
The training I have received during my time as an officer in the Army has given me experience in the management of personnel on the ground, in a multi-crew airborne environment and in the making of time critical decisions.\\\\
